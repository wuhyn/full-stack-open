# Country App

## Functionality
The Country App features a simple search bar that will allow users to search for and display detailed information about a country.

The search bar is based on a wildcard search pattern:
- If there are more than 10 countries matching the search pattern, it will not display a warning message.
- If there are 10 or less countries, it will display a list of 10 countries matching the search pattern and button to display that country's detailed information.
- If there is exactly one country, it will display a country's detailed information

## Detailed information of a country
The Country App will show a country's details including the capital city, the country area code, a list of spoken languages and the weather of the capital city.
